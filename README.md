# Welcome to the Repository!

In this repo, you'll find Shell Scripts that will assist you on instalation of a few programs needed to development and daily usage.
Take into account that those were tested in Ubuntu 20.04. Follow the steps below to proceed:

- Download Scripts and unzip them.
- Open the terminal into the same folder as the scripts were unzipped.
- Open `installer.sh`, change the lines about Name and Email from Github SSH and save. 
- Run all scripts with `installer.sh` on terminal, it's responsable of running some scripts in sequence.
- To run an script use `./scriptname.sh`.
- If the script dont work(execute), run the following line: `chmod +x scriptname.sh` and run the script again.

## Points of warning.
- Dont run scripts with `sudo`. If its necessary will be added into the script.
- If any script return "dont exist", check the script to see if is there any update to it with the current developer(company that created the package).
